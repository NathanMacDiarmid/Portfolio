            <h2>
                Project Goal
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This portfolio website has been something that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time, and for
                it to finally come to fruition is quite a personal accomplishment for myself. The goal I set for this
                project was to display all my projects and self-accomplishments on a self-made portfolio that I could use
                to send employers. I also wanted to learn how to deploy a web application from start to finish, from coding my
                first HTML tags and styling them with CSS, to deploying it. Now that it's released, it serves as my personal
                playground for anything web development related.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Project Breakdown
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was broken down into four file types:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML page files</li>
                <li>HTML project page files</li>
                <li>JavaScript files</li>
                <li>CSS file</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The HTML page files contain the HTML code for any of the pages on the website. It laid out
                all of the skeletal structures of the website so it was easy for the CSS to apply changes and
                styling to each of the specific tags or classes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The HTML project page files contain the HTML code specifically related to each project. They all
                contain a video (if there is one), a link to the source code or documentation, and a breakdown (this)
                of how that project was completed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It also contains a few JavaScript files that handle specific tasks. At the moment, it includes the Pong
                game, functionality for the contact form, and the functionality for the scroll to top button.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Finally, everything is styled via a single CSS file. It contains all classes, id’s and various global
                CSS stylings specifically related to HTML, all divs, or the entire website for example.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Thought Process & Design
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Throughout my co-op term at IBM, I worked on Planning Analytics, a web application that allows companies
                to analyze their business data. Although I spent a year of my time working on PA at IBM, I was mainly focused
                on writing JavaScript in order to manipulate the DOM, providing test suites for PA. Toward the end of my time there,
                I began receiving development tasks, editing the CSS and SCSS. Because of this co-op term, I was really intrigued by
                the concept of web development, and wanted to know how to create a web app from start to finish.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Before I began the actual coding portion of the website, I used Figma, a graphic designing software, to create a prototype
                of my website. This included how I wanted it to look, animation ideas, colour codes, and header images. I used Figma because
                it integrates really well with web development as it will give direct colour codes as well as HTML and CSS code for specific
                spacing, allowing me to get the exact spacing I needed for a specific feature.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With a basic knowledge of how HTML and CSS worked and how they integrated together, I began this project by improving my knowledge
                of HTML and CSS, learning on the fly. As the project progressed, my skills and knowledge of how HTML should be laid out so that it's
                easier for CSS to manipulate it, definitely improved.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I learned how to properly format HTML tags such as divs and sections so that the CSS could properly format them into either flex boxes,
                or have them float inside a flexbox. I had to use both technologies in this website as there were times that I needed to float divs or text
                to one side of the screen and the justify-content flex box command wouldn’t work; or I needed the text to wrap around a portion of the flex box,
                for example, I floated my image on the ‘About’ page so that the text wrapped around the image.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also decided to use an application programming interface (API) to an SMTP server so that I can have emails sent directly to my email from my
                website via the contact form. I did this using JavaScript and the Elastic Email API. I used the secure token linked to my account so that emails
                can be sent safely without my personal email and password being stored on the source code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my Figma prototype, I had an image of a Pong game, which I used as a placeholder for the ‘Home’ page’s header until the Pong JavaScript game
                was finished. I did this using ChatGPT to create the pong game canvas itself, which I inserted into my code. I then edited the given code so that
                it formatted correctly into my website home page. Lastly, I personally added the divider in the middle so that it felt closer to a real Pong game
                than just to paddles hitting a ball back and forth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The last JavaScript file that I developed with this release of my website was the scroll to top button. I wanted to give users to constantly have access
                to the navigation bar at the top of the website. To solve this issue, I implemented a scroll to top button that appears on every page once you scroll down
                a small amount from the top of the page. The JavaScript for this button is an EventListener, which waits for the user to scroll down 100 pixels from the top
                of the page. If a user scrolls back to the top of the page, the button disappears. Finally, when a user clicks the button, it automatically brings the user back
                to the top of that specific page, giving them access to the navigation bar at the top of each page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, I really enjoyed this project and will continue to enjoy this project as it will be in a constant state of development. I learned a lot about web development
                and certainly satisfied my goal of learning how to develop a web application from start to finish. I am glad to have added web development to my tool set and am looking
                forward to adding new features as time progresses.
