                This Monopoly game can load multiple different boards, save and reload a game
                to play later and even play against an AI player! It was build using the Model

            <h2>
                Project Goal
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Monopoly project was proposed to my team and I as part of my course work towards my Software
                Engineering degree at Carleton University. The goal was to develop a Monopoly game using the Model
                View Controller Architecture. In later project iterations, we were also required to implement different
                loadable boards that could be loaded into and played with via XML files. We were also instructed to have
                users save and load their games via XML files, allowing them to load saved games and continue from where
                they left off. Towards the end of the project, we were also instructed to implement an AI that would allow
                users to play alone with the AI playing automatically by itself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Project Breakdown
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                All the files were broken down into seven categories:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Model</li>
                <li>View</li>
                <li>Controller</li>
                <li>SAX Handler</li>
                <li>Special Space</li>
                <li>Players</li>
                <li>Properties</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                In our case, we only used one Model called the “MonopolyModel”, and it handled all the business logic for the
                entire game. It organized and properly called all the Action Listeners from different files so that a user can play
                Monopoly the way it is intended to be played.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A View file is responsible for rendering what the users sees, it is a direct mirror of what is implemented in the business 
                logic or “MonopolyModel”. In our case, we have one called the “MonopolyView” and it contains the user interface rendering
                including the board, properties, and various buttons.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Controller files are responsible for controlling all the actions that are inputted by a user playing Monopoly via Action
                Listeners. For example, if a player lands on “Boardwalk” and wants to buy the property, they must click the “Buy Property”
                button. This triggers an Action Listener that allows the “MonopolyModel” to execute a player buying that specific property
                and adds it to that players list of properties.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The SAX Handler files handle all the XML parsing. This is what allowed users to load in different boards as well as save
                and load current and previous games.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A Special Space is an iconic Monopoly space such as “Go”, “Go to Jail”, “Jail”, and “Free Parking”. These spaces take up the
                four corners of any board and have very specific logic. For example, the “Go to Jail” space automatically moves the player to
                the “Jail” space and keeps them there for three turns unless they role doubles or pay.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A player can join the game to a maximum of four players. This includes up to three AI players. Each player has the option to
                buy and sell properties they land on or own, as well as placing houses and hotels on properties where they own the entire set.
                The AI, however, plays automatically, buying each property it lands on regardless of the current game scenario, unless it doesn’t
                have enough money. If any type of player lands on a property that another player owns, the rent amount is automatically subtracted
                from the player that landed on the property and moved to the property owners’ funds.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Properties all have the same features:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy</li>
                <li>Sell</li>
                <li>Add House</li>
                <li>Add Hotel</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                These features can be done at the beginning of each player’s turn or if they land on a property. There are also a few properties that
                don’t allow buying houses and have a minor logic difference than regular properties. “Railroad” and “Utilities” are the two properties
                on each board that a player can purchase but isn’t allowed to place houses or hotels. For example, the “Utilities” properties pay the
                owner rent based on the amount of “Utilities” properties the owner owns and the number on the offending player’s dice.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Thought Process & Design
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                We began by creating a simple example of the MVC Architecture as part of a lab for this class. We had a simple View which was rendered
                from the Model and had buttons that were controlled by the Controller. This lab only had three files, a lot smaller scale than the Monopoly project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We then built upon this basic example by creating multiple Views and Controllers that oversaw rendering different portions of the Model.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We began by creating the Model, Player, and Dice logic which didn’t quite allow us to play yet but did a lot of the up-front logic work so that it would
                be easier to play. We then implemented a board using XML and SAX parsing, allowing for the boards to be loaded into the game. Next, we added a View and
                Controllers for each of the buttons and properties, allowing the game to finally be played on a base state.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Controllers were split up into various classes that controlled a very specific type of action. For example, there is a specific Controller for adding
                houses and hotels to properties. We did this because it allowed the Controller idea to be decoupled and the Controller files quite small and easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With our base game up and running, we then were tasked with creating different boards that could be selected at startup and loaded into the game using the SAX
                parsing that we had already implemented. After this, we were tasked with allowing players to save and load current and past games. The games were saved and loaded
                from an XML file, including player properties, amount of money, position, etc.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the final iteration, we were tasked with creating an artificial intelligence which would allow users to play alone or add AI player(s) to their game. We chose
                to make the AI by creating a separate Player class that had different logic. For example, if the AI lands on a property, it will automatically buy the property
                unless it can’t afford it. Similar to the Player, the funds are automatically moved from an AI to another AI or a player.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, this was a really fun project that allowed us to create a basic computer game complete with saving, loading and AI functionalities. I learned that you don’t
                necessarily need to train a neural network to create an AI as well as how to save and load different files into games. Additionally, I learned how to separate and
                decouple various parts of a software program so that it is easier to read and navigate when making changes.
