            <h2>
                Project Goal
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was proposed to me during my studies toward my Software Engineering degree at Carleton
                University during the course COMP 3005 - Database Management Systems. The goal of this project was to
                spend the entire term gradually building a database system from what we were taught in class. The final
                product needed to be a fully functional SQL database with a user interface to perform a function or search
                functionality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Project Breakdown
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was broken down into four different steps throughout the semester:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Schema</li>
                <li>Entity relationship model (ER) model</li>
                <li>SQL database</li>
                <li>User interface</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The schema is a collection of tables that contain attributes. These help differentiate
                the entities and their attributes in an easy to read format. The schema that was made also
                had general assumptions to aid in avoiding possible confusion regarding the different entities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                An entity is a real word thing, something that can hold different properties whereas an attribute
                is a property of the entity. For example, my name is Nathan and I have blue eyes and blonde hair.
                The entity would be myself and the attributes would be blue eyes and blonde hair. The relationship
                part of ER model is how different entities interact and relate with each other.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The entity relationship model (ER model) is a diagram that depicts all the entities in relation to
                one another. It also contains all their attributes and primary key(s) that each entity may use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The SQL database file was made with SQL queries and stored in the already existing database file.
                It also contains queries to access different information stored in the database file tables such as
                getting an attribute.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The user interface calls the SQL queries within the SQL file and displays them to the user. This
                allows a non-technical user to use and access the created database
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Thought Process & Design
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the semester, we were asked to choose a topic for our final project and told that it
                needed to be a database with a user interface. I decided that a class database would useful and a cool design,
                so that is the idea that I decided.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The schema was the first part to be created as it was early in the semester, and we had just begun learning about
                the structure of SQL databases. We needed to have at least three entities, each with at least one primary key that
                could be used to access an exact portion of the data. For example, a student number would be used to access a studentâ€™s
                name, program, email, and grade point average.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The ER model was the following part that needed to be created, as it depicts how each of the tables, or entities react
                with one another and their attributes. There needed to be at least two N to N relationships between entities, meaning that
                each entity can have any number of itself and can interact with any number of other entities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each of the entities only interact with another specific entity in this case. The Students only interact with the Classes
                and the Classes only interact with the Professors. The Professors may not interact directly with the Students or vice versa
                for the purposes of the database. However, the Students can see Professors information if they are teaching a Class and Professors
                can see Students information in the Class they are teaching.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The SQL database was made using an SQL file that inserted data into a database file. It creates the three different tables of Students,
                Classes and Professors, and inserts all the respective data into those tables in the database file. All the data is respective to the ER
                model, for example, each student has a name, student number, email, program, grade point average, and lists of current, past, and future
                required classes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I created the user interface by using Python to display a window with multiple different search buttons and hidden windows that displayed
                queries results from the database file linked within the Python file. It then had various functions that used SQL queries to search through
                the database and display results on the given windows. These queries could show the current Classes that a Student is taking for example, and
                it would return a list of all the current Classes and Student is taking.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, I enjoyed this project as I learned a lot about databases and linking them directly with a user interface, especially after learning
                so much about databases themselves and their design or tools such as normalization.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also learned how to create a user interface with Python as I had normally done it with Java using Swing, so it was a nice change to learn a
                new way of designing user interfaces.
