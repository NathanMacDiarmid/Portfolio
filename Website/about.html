            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since I was little, I was always interested in technology, however, I was intimidated
                by the amount of information available online. Unsure where to start, I tried
                various experiences in order to find my "purpose". This took me
                toward a year long exchange to Belgium where I was completely immersed in the
                French Belgian culture. During this exchange, I got to experience what it's like to
                live in another country and see how people from different parts of the world live
                on a regular basis.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                While I was there, I spoke French 24/7 unless I was in the north part of the country,
                or with other exchange students that came from all parts of the world, to which I spoke
                English. I lived with various host families throughout the year so that I could see how
                different people with different backgrounds lived in Belgium, all giving me very different
                experiences and opportunities.

                <br>
                <br>

                When I wasn't in school or spending time with my families, I was travelling to different
                cities in Belgium and Europe. During my year, I visited eight different European countries.
                Because of the amount of time that I spent on trains and busses, I got the opportunity to
                think about what I wanted to do with my life and what direction I would take. This landed
                me on the idea of becoming a Software Engineer as I knew I was always interested in technology
                and found myself missing tinkering with different technologies. I was certainly able to do a
                lot of personal development and self-growing in Belgium, allowing me to find my "purpose".
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Return from Belgium</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Upon my return to my hometown of Miramichi New Brunswick in July 2019, I worked as a Social Media Manager
                at Discover Miramichi, a tourism company based in my hometown. I spent that summer travelling
                around the Miramichi region and various parts of New Brunswick to take photos and videos to promote tourism
                on the Discover Miramichi social pages. During this time, I was also preparing to begin my Software Engineering
                degree that Fall at Carleton University in Ottawa Ontario.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Move to Ottawa</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Coming from a small town in New Brunswick and moving to Ottawa Ontario was certainly a large shift. I had been to
                different big cities before to visit and I had loved them, but I found living in the city itself so much more fulfilling
                and exciting. Even the large jump in population from Miramichi to Carleton University alone was surprising. Miramichi has
                a population of around 18,000 people, whereas the population of Carleton Campus alone is 30,000 people. This was certainly
                an eye opener for me to see how large the world really was.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Degree Troubles</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my first semester of Software Engineering, I had to take some of the required common courses that all Engineers
                must take. Two of these courses were Statics and Dynamics, how things do not move and move, respectively. Coming off
                a year where I was much more in tune with the personal side of myself, it was hard to quickly transition to a
                very technical side of myself. I found myself struggling in these courses and seeking help whenever possible. I had
                a lot of thought, especially toward the middle of the semester, whether Engineering was for me, if I was even
                capable.

                <br>
                <br>

                After finishing that semester and going home for Christmas, passing Statics and Dynamics by the skin of my
                teeth, I was having real doubts about returning for my second semester, did I make the wrong choice? I decided
                to stick with it as the semester coming up had the core Engineering courses for my degree, Software Development
                and Mechatronics. This is where my degree took off and my love for technologies and development began.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>COVID</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because of COVID, I had to finish this semester back home in Miramichi, isolated in my house with my brother,
                mother, and father. I passed all my courses with a very good understanding of the concepts,
                solid marks, and a re-found love of technology, reasuring the idea of me becoming a Software Engineer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Career</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                After my second year of my degree, I was eligible to do one of the required four-month coop terms attached
                to my degree. The summer of 2021, I was able to secure a Data Analyst position at Global Affairs Canada,
                a branch of the Canadian government that manages international relations, trade and financial aide. I was
                specifically collaborating with the financial aide portion.

                <br>
                <br>

                During my time there, I was tasked with developing a way to analyze their aide budgets to determine how much
                money was being spent in different portions of the budgets collectively. I became very proficient in IBM Cognos,
                Excel and the French language in a professional setting as I used all three to develop the tool.

                <br>
                <br>

                I definitely learned a lot during this coop as it was my first ever "big boy job" and opened my eyes to how
                the government and professional workplaces function. I am incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity
                to work with Global Affairs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>IBM</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Upon the conclusion of my first coop term, I returned to my studies and quickly realized that I much more
                enjoyed the professional atmosphere and how professionals learn than being stuck in a classroom. I wanted
                to return to the professional world as quickly as I could.

                <br>
                <br>

                After my Fall semester, I was eligible for a longer coop term of 12 months that I could split up as three
                different coop terms or one large one, just as examples. In January 2022, I began an eight-month coop term
                with IBM as an Automation and Test Developer.

                <br>
                <br>

                I thoroughly enjoyed this placement to the point where I asked for an extension of four months, making the
                coop term an entire year. During this time, I was able to switch from the role of Automation and Test
                Developer to Software Developer. Using technologies like NodeJS and Jenkins, I transformed the testing
                suite for Planning Analytics, a sister software similar to Cognos, not only making it much more efficient,
                but also increasing the coverage by almost 300%.

                <br>
                <br>

                This coop placement opened my eyes even farther, showing me how a large private technology company operates.
                Toward the end of the placement, it certainly reinforced the choice of studying Software Engineering.
            </p>

            <h3>Outside of work</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Outside of the career opportunities that I was incredibly lucky and grateful to receive, I enjoy spending time with
                family and friends as they are a large reason I am where I am today. I still enjoy travelling, but I have not
                gotten the chance to do much of it as I have been focused on my degree. Finally, I referee Junior Hockey on the
                weekends during the winter. It is something I get a lot of enjoyment out of as I received two concussions from
                hockey when I was younger, and refereeing keeps me involved in the sport.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Where I am now</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am now going into my final year of my degree with a fourth-year project lined up. I am excited and a little
                bit nervous as to where my life will go once I am finished school, but I am certain that it will be in the
                right direction. Becoming a Software Engineer was certainly the best choice I could have made.
