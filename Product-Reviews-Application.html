            <h2>
                Project Goal
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Product Reviews Web App project was proposed to my team and I as part of my course work towards my
                Software Engineering degree at Carleton University. The goal of this project was to learn how to develop a basic
                RESTful web application from start to finish. This included setting up a GitHub repository with security features
                for multiple collaborators, development of multiple RESTful API endpoints, deploying the web application to the cloud,
                and a CI/CD pipeline that runs our tests and automatically deploys our updated code to our cloud instance on Azure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Project Breakdown
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The project was broken down into four file types:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Business logic</li>
                <li>DevOps files</li>
                <li>Monitoring files</li>
                <li>RESTful endpoints</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The business logic was split up into three main files, a Client, a Product, and a Review.
                Each of these served as a different entity by having the Client be a user who can log in and
                create an account, containing username, list of reviews, and number of followers; the Product being
                individual products containing names, descriptions, and an average rating; and the Review being the
                intertwine between the Client and the Product by allowing Clients to add a Review to a Product containing
                the rating and the comment on the Product.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The DevOps file is contained in the master_productreviewswebapp.yml file and includes the CI/CD pipeline,
                running our automated testing suite, as well as our automatic deployment script that deploys our web app to
                Microsoft Azure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The monitoring files are the .yml files located under the monitoring folder. These .yml files allow us to
                track user visits, usage, and other useful insights using Prometheus and then visualize them using Grafana.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The RESTful endpoints are how we communicated between the Client, Product, and Review entities. This also
                allowed us to create and delete cookie values to store users that are logged in which in turn allowed us to
                calculate the Jaccard Distance between the logged in user and other users in the database.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Thought Process & Design
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was given to my team and I during our final year of my Software Engineering degree. We were
                tasked with creating a Software as a Service (SaaS) project based on one of the following seven ideas:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Perk manager</li>
                <li>Trustworthy product reviews</li>
                <li>Amazin online bookstore</li>
                <li>Mini-Shopify</li>
                <li>Mini-SurveyMonkey</li>
                <li>Graduate Admissions Management System</li>
                <li>4th Year Project Management System</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                We were also tasked with choosing a subtopic that was group specific, with options such as HTMX, using Spring with MongoDB,
                and much more! After a group discussion, we all agreed to go with the product reviews idea with a subtopic of using Prometheus
                and Grafana to monitor and analyze our SaaS application's statistics and insights.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each of the seven ideas had a paragraph attached to it which explained the general idea as well as functional and non-functional
                requirements which we need to identify. This is how we were able to form our separate Client, Product, and Review entities. From
                this paragraph, we also identified the ability to follow and unfollow users, the degree of separation between users, as well as the
                Jaccard Distance between users.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We were then tasked to take these functional and non-functional requirements and concretely display them as Issues on the GitHub
                repository that our projects codebase is stored. This allowed us to accurately track what needed to be done, who needed to do it,
                and organize all the work into three sprints for each milestone using Agile methodology.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first step we took was to initialize a SpringBoot project which gave us access to the creation of RESTful API's, Hibernate Object
                Relational Mapping (ORM) and instance database, and Java bean creation. Once this was done, we began creating various RESTful API's that
                we could call in various places in our application as well as outside of our application through requests on Postman for example.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Next, we set up Hibernate as a per-instance database, meaning that it will only store information in the database while the current tab
                of a browser is open. Once the browser tab closes, the database is wiped and deleted to free up storage. Because of this, we needed to
                populate the application at run time. We did this by injecting Java beans into the database via the ORM and our RESTful API's. Although
                we could have integrated another database such as MongoDB where the data remained permanently, the goal of this project was to simply
                familiarize ourselves with creating a SaaS application from scratch and we needed to ensure we covered all our other functional and non-functional
                requirements.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly, in terms of overall project structure, we set up a CI/CD pipeline using a .yml file, GitHub actions, and terminal commands. This allowed
                us to build our project within GitHub itself based on our pom.xml file and then automatically run our tests against this temporarily created application
                environment. We then set permissions on the repository to run this file any time a pull request was open to merge into the master branch. If the tests were
                successful, you were allowed to merge, otherwise, you needed to fix your code before merging. Additionally, this CI/CD pipeline would run another .yml file
                through GitHub actions that would automatically deploy any changes merged into the master branch to our Azure instance, making it available for anyone immediately
                after merging.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once the overall structure of the project was completed, we began adding our other requirements such as integrating Prometheus and Grafana as well as the degrees
                of separation and the Jaccard distance between users. Additionally, throughout the course of the project, we continually polished up areas of the application such
                as general stylings or performance improvements.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To integrate Prometheus and Grafana, we needed to install and integrate their docker images to our application. We used documentation found online to do this and
                successfully deployed the monitoring and visualization tools to our application. Unfortunately, we were unable to deploy it to our Azure instance as the student
                instance we were using had some limitations that prevented us from doing so.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly, we implemented two algorithms that allowed users to see other users based on who they follow as well as how similar they are to those users. We displayed
                new unfollowed users to the current user using a degree of separation algorithm which basically calculates the how far two users are from one another. For example,
                if I follow Evan, and Evan follows George, but I don't follow George the degree of separation between me and George would be 1 and the degree of separation between
                Evan and I would be 0. With that being said, we would return a list of the first five users with the lowest degree of separation as suggestions for the current user
                to follow, removing any with a degree of separation of 0, seeing as they already follow that user.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The second algorithm was the Jaccard distance algorithm. The Jaccard distance is an algorithm that we used to display each users' similarity score to one another.
                For example, if Evan and I both reviewed the same product on our application and only that product, we would have a Jaccard distance or similarity score of 1 or 100%,
                saying that we are exactly alike. If Evan and I both review different products, but neither of us have a product where we both reviewed, we would have a Jaccard distance
                or similarity score of 0(%). If we both had a varying degree of reviews with some common products and some not, we would have a Jaccard distance or similarity score of
                roughly 0.5 or 50%. Based on these examples, when a user would find new users to potentially follow, you could check the Jaccard distance of that user to you to determine
                how similar they are to you, in our case, based on product reviews. This algorithm in our context was used specifically for determining similarities between users and
                product reviews, however, it can be applied in various circumstances where you need to calculate how similar one thing is to another.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, this project was a cool eye opener for me as it taught me how most enterprise level web applications work as a whole. Although most enterprise level web
                applications are much larger than this and contain many more features, security protocols, and properly configured databases, it certainly taught me a lot about the
                overall structure and inner workings of these applications. Additionally, it also taught me how to develop, test, and use API's internally and externally from within
                an application in Java to which I was able to translate to React in my free time. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project especially with the strong and talented
                team that assisted me as none of use knew that these types of applications existed nor how they worked, and with each others support we gave each other that understanding.
